I hate it when you do
I said "no thanks" to you

What if I wasn't
Leaving is fine
It's just I don't wanna be all by myself again
Like every time, like every last time
You knew that I was no good for you
When we lay down after doing that things you loved
You knew that I wasn't better than you
I hope that I could be seemed really fine with you leaving

I said "I know you love me, too"
I asked you
"If you are the same, what if I quit it"
Leaving is fine
It's just I don't wanna be falling behind again
Like every time, like every moment in the end
You knew that I was no good for you
When we lay down after doing that things you loved
You knew that I wasn'tâ€¦
