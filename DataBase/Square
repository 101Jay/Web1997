I like that you pray before you sleep and
You hat missing church on a Sunday
And I like that we're not there yet but
You always tell me we'll get there someday
And when you get dolled up on a special evening
Or when we just ball up on a day we're sleeping in
I fall in love again I fall in love again
And I knew from the start
That you'd take my heart
And now here we are
And you help me remember
That things will only get better
This is my love my love letter
I like that you asked if we could stay in
Taking pictures making dinner on your birthday
And I like how you look when you read your book
I've loved it since the first day
And when you get dolled up on a special evening
Or when we just ball up on a day were sleeping in
I fall in love again I fall in loveâ€¦
