This holiday
You'll be far away
And I'll be all alone
So please remember
This December
To fully charge your phone
And
Text me Merry Christmas
Let me know you care
Just a word or two
Of text from you
Will remind me you're still there You don't have to add much to it
One smiley face will do
Baby text me Merry Christmas
Cause I'm missing kissing you
Text me Merry Christmas
Make my holiday complete
Though you're far from me
Say you'll brb
That's a text I'll never delete
Choose just the right emoji
One that makes me lol
And if you text me something naughty I promise I won't tell
I don't care if you spell things right
I just want to hear from you tonight
Stroke those keys with your delicate touch
And type those little words that mean so much!
